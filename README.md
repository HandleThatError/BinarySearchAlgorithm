BinarySearchAlgorithm
=====================

A Java implementation of a binary search 

I included the test cases in the same file for ease of access. The test cases were written during
code testing to make sure the right insertion points are given. The algorithm was written to give
the proper insertion points. The binary search featured here doesn't actually insert anything yet
since the point of the project was to write code that gives us the right insertion points every time.
